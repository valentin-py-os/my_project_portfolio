ðŸš€ Data Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my personal data projects â€” each showcasing different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and data engineering.

These projects were developed using tools like **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and **SQL**. I built them as part of my learning journey and to explore real-world datasets through data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and storytelling.

Feel free to explore each folder to see what I've been working on!

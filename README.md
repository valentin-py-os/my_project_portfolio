Hello, my name is Valentin. I am a Junior Data Scientist and a student at WU Vienna. I am into Machine Learning, Web Automation and BI. I work with Python, Pandas and NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc. I also specialize in the Finance alongside with the Data Science field and seek to create the best IT-solutions for you and your business. I'm currently open to exciting opportunities — whether it's:

🚀 Freelance or private project collaborations, or

🧑‍💼 Full-time employment with forward-thinking teams and organizations

Feel free to reach out if you have a project, role, or idea in mind — I'm always eager to learn, build, and contribute!

*******************
My latest projects:

"Store Analytics Project"

This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail store performance data. It analyzes key metrics such as sales, number of items sold, coupon usage, and delivery status. The project includes data cleaning, feature transformation, and visualization techniques to uncover customer behavior patterns and operational insights. Ideal for demonstrating skills in pandas, data wrangling, and business intelligence.

"Jeopardy! Dataset Analysis"

This script analyzes historical data from the Jeopardy! game show. It begins by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, renaming columns and converting monetary values. It includes functionality to:

- Search and filter questions containing specific keywords
- Calculate average question value
- Analyze frequently repeated answers

The project showcases skills in data preprocessing, text filtering with regular expressions, and basic statistics using pandas. It’s a great example of working with text-heavy datasets and performing custom queries for insights.
